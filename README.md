# A collection of algorithms

### The following algorithms are currently published:

1. A*
2. Beam search
3. Tabu search

### A collection of applied algorithms:

1. The knapsack problem solved by dynamic programming.
2. Local search applied to the k-queens problem.
3. A sudoku solver.

### Neural networks:

1. A very beginner friendly and readable neural netork implementation.
2. And a much faster numpy implementation.

### Notes:
The knapsack algorithm returns a set which contains the least "heavy" approach to achieving every possible cost value.
