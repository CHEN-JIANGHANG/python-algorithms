# A collection of algorithms

### The following algorithms are currently published:
1. A*
2. Beam search
3. Tabu search

### A collection of applied algorithms:
1. The knapsack problem solved by dynamic programming. The algorithm returns a set containing the min cost permutation of achieving all possible values.
2. Local search applied to the k-queens problem.
3. A sudoku solver.

### Neural networks:
1. A very beginner friendly and readable neural network implementation.
2. And a much faster numpy implementation.
